My handbook on facilitation which is a useful skill.

# Facilitating, Teaching, and Lecturing

| Type | Who controls what is being learned | Type of Participation | Comments |
| ---  | ---                                | ---                   | ---     |
| Facilitating | The Group                  | Facilitator + entire group | Good for collaborative learning |
| Teaching | Educator primarily             | Mostly from educator, little from group | |
| Lecturing | Educator solely               | Solely from educator | More if a clear message/topic must be transferred |
