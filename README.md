# Facilitating, Teaching, and Lecturing

> TIP: Pick what is most suitable to your goal 

| Type | Who controls what is being learned | Type of Participation | Comments |
| ---  | ---                                | ---                   | ---     |
| Facilitating | The Group                  | Facilitator + entire group | Good for collaborative learning |
| Teaching | Educator primarily             | Mostly from educator, little from group | |
| Lecturing | Educator solely               | Solely from educator | More if a clear message/topic must be transferred |

# Facilitation Types

* Experiential Facilitation: Facilitate experiences for people to learn by doing. Also known as adventure or outdoor education.
    * Examples: Conflict resolution, Communication, and problem solving.
* Dialogue Facilitation: Building bridges rather than walls.
    * Examples: Put strangers in a circle and talk about given topic(s) (e.g. Politics, Race, Opinions)
* General Facilitation: More like in business, run a meeting. A general batch, but skills from Experiential and Dialogue facilitation can help tremendously.

# Core Skills

* Authenticity: Be yourself while facilitating, don't try to be someone else. If they see you have a "mask" on, you might face resistance. 
* Clarity: Your instructions and guidance must be clear, else people will get lost.
    * F.O.G.S: Framing, Objective, Guidelines and Safety - A framework for clarity.
        * Framing: Situate the context. You got to change the context and make it relevant for everybody.
            * Example: Share a story that leads into the purpose or objective of whatever you're doing.
        * Objective: Clarify/share a clear object for given activity or whole session
            * Example: "Share (personal) stories, without sharing opinions" - now a clear objective was set
        * Guidelines: Rules of engagement. Sometimes adding rules makes your gathering better.
        * Safety: Try to increase both
            * Physical: If people gonna be running around, make it safe to do so.
            * Psychological: People who run meetings often don't mention this type of safety. A highly functional team has a high degree of psychological safety. 
* Listening: It's about what you hear and what you do with that information. Listen to Feats, Aspirations, Core Message, Process.
    * The way that you listen has the power to change what you say. This includes body language. The more "listening" and positive the body language (e.g. lean in) the more they will share.

# Tips

## Deal with people who dominate conversation

* Flip The Role: Pretext your question with a request for the busy talkers to hold of. People who talk a lot know they talk a lot.
    * Example: "Hey, if you're typically one of the first people to speak, please hold back and wait to be one of the last (or 3th) to speak, is is possible might not get a chance to speak this time,  but I'd love to hear some of the  voices that not always get heard."
    * This is less directed towards individuals (e.g. hey Mark, I didn't hear you yet.)
* Creating Space: Create more space/silence for those who are a bit more hesitant to speak, to get their chance.
    * To avoid awkward silence to create productive silence. Build on top of the "Flip The Role" , by also pretexting, that you want a specific time window before anyone answers, so every can think for a moment.
    * Example: "Hey, if you're typically one of the first people to speak, please hold back and wait to be one of the last (or 3th) to speak, is is possible might not get a chance to speak this time,  but I'd love to hear some of the  voices that not always get heard. I am going to ask this question, and then pause in total silence for 5 seconds to wait for everyone to think of their own response before we share."
    * Even if the 5 seconds pass, let them take the time.
* Change the mechanics: Domination could be because of the people, but because of the structure of the meeting.
    * Split out into groups to have discussions (breakout sessions) and then report back what you heard other people in your group say (not what you said).
* Steering into the curve:
