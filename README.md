My handbook on facilitation which is a useful skill.

# Facilitating, Teaching, and Lecturing

> TIP: Pick what is most suitable to your goal 

| Type | Who controls what is being learned | Type of Participation | Comments |
| ---  | ---                                | ---                   | ---     |
| Facilitating | The Group                  | Facilitator + entire group | Good for collaborative learning |
| Teaching | Educator primarily             | Mostly from educator, little from group | |
| Lecturing | Educator solely               | Solely from educator | More if a clear message/topic must be transferred |

# Facilitation Types

* Experiential Facilitation: Facilitate experiences for people to learn by doing. Also known as adventure or outdoor education.
    * Examples: Conflict resolution, Communication, and problem solving.
* Dialogue Facilitation: Building bridges rather than walls.
    * Examples: Put strangers in a circle and talk about given topic(s) (e.g. Politics, Race, Opinions)
* General Facilitation: More like in business, run a meeting. A general batch, but skills from Experiential and Dialogue facilitation can help tremendously.

# Core Skills

* Authenticity: Be yourself while facilitating, don't try to be someone else. If they see you have a "mask" on, you might face resistance. 
* Clarity: Your instructions and guidance must be clear, else people will get lost.
    * F.O.G.S: Framing, Objective, Guidelines and Safety - A framework for clarity.
        * Framing: Situate the context. You got to change the context and make it relevant for everybody.
            * Example: Share a story that leads into the purpose or objective of whatever you're doing.
        * Objective: Clarify/share a clear object for given activity or whole session
            * Example: "Share (personal) stories, without sharing opinions" - now a clear objective was set
        * Guidelines: Rules of engagement. Sometimes adding rules makes your gathering better.
        * Safety: Try to increase both
            * Physical: If people gonna be running around, make it safe to do so.
            * Psychological: People who run meetings often don't mention this type of safety. A highly functional team has a high degree of psychological safety. 
* Listening: It's about what you hear and what you do with that information. Listen to Feats, Aspirations, Core Message, Process.
    * The way that you listen has the power to change what you say. This includes body language. The more "listening" and positive the body language (e.g. lean in) the more they will share.
